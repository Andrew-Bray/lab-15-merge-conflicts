# lab-15-merge-conflicts

- For one, Bob and Carol didn't git pull before starting to work on fubar.md, so they didn't have the updated code that Ted and Alice worked on. They definitely lived to regret it and now have to spend years in therapy. 
- _*CAROL*_ forgot to save locally NUMEROUS times..... typical. This caused the push to not happen correctly. And caused tons of confusion. Therapy for all. 
- *BOB* only pulled the updated code to his own branch instead of also on the main branch, which caused issues as well. 
- Moving forward, we should make sure to only work on separate files if we're working at the same time, and _git pull origin main_ often.
